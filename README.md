# WarCode

[Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nazarpunk.warcode) for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for vanilla jass syntax highlight.

Based on [Chevrotain](https://chevrotain.io) library. [Playground](https://chevrotain.io/playground).

[Lexing rules](https://nazarpunk.github.io/warcode) based in [jassjs](https://github.com/PBug90/jassjs) but much improved.
